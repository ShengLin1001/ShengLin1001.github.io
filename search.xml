To solve the Kohn–Sham equations, we need to define the Hartree potential, and to define the Hartree potential we need to know the electron density. But to find the electron density, we must know the single-electron wave functions, and to know these wave functions we must solve the Kohn–Sham equations. To break this circle, the problem is usually treated in an iterative way as outlined in the following algorithm:</p><ol><li>Define an initial, trial electron density, $n(r)$.</li><li>Solve the Kohn–Sham equations defined using the trial electron density to find the single-particle wave functions, $\psi_i(r)$.</li><li>Calculate the electron density defined by the Kohn–Sham single-particle wave functions from step 2, $n_{\mathrm{KS}}(\mathbf{r})=2\sum_{i}\psi_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{r})\psi_{i}(\mathbf{r})$</li><li>Compare the calculated electron density, $n_{KS}(r)$, with the electron density used in solving the Kohn–Sham equations, $n(r)$. If the two densities are the same, then this is the ground-state electron density, and it can be used to compute the total energy. If the two densities are different, then the trial electron density must be updated in some way. Once this is done, the process begins again from step 2.</li></ol></li><li><p>We have skipped over a whole series of important details in this process</p><ul><li>How close do the two electron densities have to be before we consider them to be the same?</li><li>What is a good way to update the trial electron density?</li><li>How should we define the initial density? </li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="1-5-Exchange-correlation-functional-E-XC-psi-i"><a href="#1-5-Exchange-correlation-functional-E-XC-psi-i" class="headerlink" title="1.5 Exchange-correlation functional, $E_{XC}[\{\psi_i\}]$"></a>1.5 Exchange-correlation functional, $E_{XC}[\{\psi_i\}]$</h3><ul><li><p>Fortunately, there is one case where this functional can be derived exactly: <strong>the uniform electron gas</strong> (the electron density is constant at all points in space, $n(r) = constant$)  <strong>(approximation 3)</strong></p></li><li><p>This situation may appear to be of limited value in any real material since it is variations in electron density that define <strong>chemical bonds</strong> and generally make materials interesting.</p></li><li><p>we set the exchange–correlation potential at each position to be the known exchange–correlation potential from the uniform electron gas at the electron density observed at that position. </p><script type="math/tex; mode=display">V_{\mathrm{XC}}(\mathbf{r})=V_{\mathrm{XC}}^{\text{electron gas}}[n(\mathbf{r})]</script></li><li><p>This approximation uses only the <strong>local density</strong> to define the approximate exchange–correlation functional, so it is called the <strong>local density approximation (LDA)</strong>.</p></li><li><p>The best known class of functional after the LDA uses information about the local electron density and the local gradient in the electron density; this approach defines a <strong>generalized gradient approximation (GGA)</strong>. It is tempting to think that because the GGA includes more physical information than the LDA it must be more accurate. <strong>Unfortunately, this is not always correct</strong>.</p><ul><li>Two of the most widely used functionals in calculations <strong>involving solids</strong> are the Perdew–Wang functional <strong>(PW91)</strong> and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional <strong>(PBE)</strong>.</li><li>Because different functionals will give somewhat different results for any particular configuration of atoms, it is necessary to specify what functional was used in any particular calculation rather than simple referring to “a DFT calculation.”</li></ul></li><li><p>Our description of GGA functionals as including information from the electron density and the gradient of this density suggests that more sophisticated functionals can be constructed that use other pieces of physical information. In fact, <strong>a hierarchy of functionals</strong> can be constructed that gradually include more and more detailed physical information.</p></li></ul><h3 id="1-6-The-Quantum-Chemistry-Tourist"><a href="#1-6-The-Quantum-Chemistry-Tourist" class="headerlink" title="1.6 The Quantum Chemistry Tourist"></a>1.6 The Quantum Chemistry Tourist</h3><ul><li><p>Localized and Spatially Extended Functions</p><ul><li><p>Spatially localized functions</p><p><img src="/images/Quantum-mechanics-Density-functional-theory/1.png" alt="Figure 1.1 Example of spatially localized functions defined in the text."></p><ul><li>Spatially localized functions are an extremely useful framework for thinking about the <strong>quantum chemistry of isolated molecules</strong> because the wave functions of isolated molecules really do decay to zero far away from the molecule.</li></ul></li><li><p>Spatially Extended functions</p><p><img src="/images/Quantum-mechanics-Density-functional-theory/2.png" alt="Figure 1.2 Example of spatially periodic functions defined in the text."></p><ul><li>We could <strong>still</strong> use spatially localized functions to describe each atom and add up these functions to describe the overall material, but this is certainly not the only way forward.<br>A useful alternative is to use <strong>periodic functions</strong> to describe the wave functions or electron densities.</li><li>This type of function is useful for describing bulk materials since at least for defect-free materials the electron density and wave function really are spatially periodic functions.</li></ul></li><li><p>Because <strong>spatially localized functions</strong> are the natural choice for <strong>isolated molecules, the quantum chemistry methods</strong> developed within <strong>the chemistry community</strong> are dominated by methods based on these functions.

But there is one crucial complication left to deal with; one that also appeared when we discussed the Kohn–Sham equations. To find the <strong>spin orbitals</strong> we must <strong>solve the single electron equations</strong>. To define the <strong>Hartree potential</strong> in the single-electron equations, we must know <strong>the electron density</strong>. But to know the electron density, we must define <strong>the electron wave function</strong>, which is found using the <strong>individual spin orbitals</strong>! To break this circle, an HF calculation is an iterative procedure that can be outlined as follows:</p><ol><li>Make an initial estimate of the spin orbitals $\chi_j(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{i=1}^K\alpha_{j,i}\phi_i(\mathbf{x})$ by specifying the expansion coefficients, $\alpha_{j,i}$</li><li>From the current estimate of the spin orbitals, define the electron density, $n(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$</li><li>Using the electron density from step 2, solve the single-electron equations for the spin orbitals.</li><li>If the spin orbitals found in step 3 are consistent with orbitals used in step 2, then these are the solutions to the HF problem we set out to calculate.

可以视为系统空间上的频率。我的理解是对于不同的晶格类型，有不同的满足布洛赫衍射的波矢，由此将波矢作为该晶格类型的一种描述。类似的频域分析也是，找到共振频率，进而分析。</p><p>我还联想到的是波粒二象性，光既不是粒子也不是波，但他有两种属性，都是实验测得的。而原子经典意义上是一个粒子，但在原子与原子的联系中又有波的性质，例如相互作用力。世界上的相互作用都是波性质的体现，因为两个原子不会紧密的接触在一起（除了密排金属），通过相互作用互相排斥或吸引。而密排金属并不是没有相互作用，恰恰相反，不然他们为啥会吸引在一起呢。只是能量最低的结构，以及能垒高低不同而已。经典力学是个宏观的概念，在原子尺度，他可以解释一些弹性阶段的事，比如将两个原子近似为弹簧连接，但远离平衡状态的现象却没法很好的解释。任何一种理论都有其特定的局限性。我觉得密度泛函理论是很普适的，也只是因为我没接触到更本征的领域而已。</p><h2
